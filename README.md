# Jaeger (Just Another phaGE identifieR)
Identifying phage genome sequences conclealed in metagenomes is a long standing problem in viral metagenomics and ecology. Although various methods have been introduced in the recent past, each methods has its own strengths and weaknesses. Recently, machine learning has gained popularity in detecting viruses in metagenome samples. Here, we introduce Jaeger a CNN based, sensitive deep learning method that outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
